# SystemsOfEquationsSolver
This systems of linear equations solver project was done using the MATLAB programming language.  
Given a system of linear equations of any number of variables, a method of several methods is chosen to solve for the unkown variables.  
Supported Methods are Gauss Elimination, Gauss Jordan, LU Decomposition, and Gauss Seidel.
